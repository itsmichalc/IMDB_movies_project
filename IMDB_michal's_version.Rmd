# Introduction

In our project we will examine
[this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsmichalc/IMDB_movies_project/main/imdb_top_1000.csv)
data set describing 1000 movies. This data set comes from the IMDB
website and it contains a great deal of intriguing information about
movies such as: popularity of genre, gross, IMDB rating, MetaScore etc.

# Goals

In today's world, we know that a successful movie not only entertains
the audience but also enables film companies to make a profit. Many
factors can affect the gross such as directors, the year of making,
ratings, and the genre.

Our research will examine how different parameters affect the gross of a
movie, specifically popular genres. In addition, we will learn how the
Meta Score rating is compared to the IMDB rating. Finally, we will
explore the correlation between the number of votes to the IMDB rating
and the revenue.

# Tidying

Let's get to know our data set by looking at it briefly.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
raw_data<-read.csv(file='C:/Users/user/Desktop/imdb_top_1000.csv')
glimpse(raw_data)

```

So we need to make some changes. First, we want to tidy the database by
dropping NA's and irrelevant categories such as "Poster_Link" ,
"Certificate" and "Overview".

```{r dataset, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

clean_data = subset(raw_data, select = -c(Poster_Link, Certificate, Overview))%>% na.omit(clean_data$Gross,clean_data$No_of_Votes,clean_data$Meta_score,clean_data$IMDB_Rating,clean_data$Runtime)
view(clean_data)
```

Secondly, we want to make some more adjustments for us to be able to
work properly: we need to remove the word "min" from the Runtime
category, remove commas from the Gross and change the numeric
information from character to integer. In addition, we want to convert
the Meta Score number from dozens to units, in order to compare it with
the IMDB rating later.

```{r tidying of the dataset, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

clean_data$Runtime <-gsub(" min","",as.character(clean_data$Runtime))

clean_data$Gross <-gsub(",","",as.character(clean_data$Gross))

clean_data <- transform(clean_data, Runtime = as.integer(Runtime),
                        Released_Year = as.integer(Released_Year), Gross = as.integer(Gross),No_of_Votes = as.integer(No_of_Votes), IMDB_Rating=as.double(IMDB_Rating), Meta_score=as.double(Meta_score))

clean_data <- mutate(clean_data,Meta_score = Meta_score/10,Gross_in_millions = Gross/1000000,votes_in_thousands= No_of_Votes/1000)

```

Now let's look at the clean data.

```{r}
glimpse(clean_data) 
```

Much better.

We can see there are a total of 12 genres in the data. But some of the
movies contain more than one genre:

```{r}
clean_data %>%
  group_by(Genre) %>%
  summarise()

```

In order to get a better view of the recurrence, we will extract and
organize each of the genres separately, present in a table, and conclude
which are the most popular genres.

```{r}

Table_Comedy<-grepl("Comedy",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Comedy<-sum(Table_Comedy)

Table_Adventure<-grepl("Adventure",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Adventure<-sum(Table_Adventure)

Table_Drama<-grepl("Drama",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Drama<-sum(Table_Drama)

Table_Romance<-grepl("Romance",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Romance<-sum(Table_Romance)

Table_Crime<-grepl("Crime",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Crime<-sum(Table_Crime)

Table_Thriller<-grepl("Thriller",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Thriller<-sum(Table_Thriller)

Table_Horror<-grepl("Horror",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Horror<-sum(Table_Horror)

Table_Action<-grepl("Action",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Action<-sum(Table_Action)

Table_Mystery<-grepl("Mystery",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Mystery<-sum(Table_Mystery)

Table_Scifi<-grepl("Sci-Fi",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Scifi<-sum(Table_Scifi)

Table_Animation<-grepl("Animation",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Animation<-sum(Table_Animation)

Table_Family<-grepl("Family",clean_data$Genre)
Num_Family<-sum(Table_Family)

tab <- matrix(c(Num_Action,Num_Adventure, Num_Animation, Num_Comedy, Num_Crime, Num_Drama, Num_Family, Num_Horror
                , Num_Mystery, Num_Romance, Num_Scifi, Num_Thriller), ncol=1, byrow=TRUE)
colnames(tab) <- c('Frequency')
rownames(tab) <- c('action','adventure','animation', 'comedy', 'crime', 'drama', 'family', 'horror', 'mystery',
                   'romance', 'scifi', 'thriller')
tab <- as.table(tab)
genres_table<-as.data.frame(tab)
genres_table = subset(genres_table, select = -c(Var2))
genres_table <- mutate(genres_table, genre_name=Var1)
genres_table = subset(genres_table, select = -c(Var1))
genres_table %>% select(genre_name, Freq)%>%arrange(desc(Freq))

```

# Visualizations

Now we can take a look at the popularity of the genres.

```{r}
true_genres <- clean_data %>%
 mutate(is_drama = str_detect(clean_data$Genre, "Drama", negate = FALSE),
 is_action = str_detect(clean_data$Genre, "Action", negate = FALSE),
 is_comedy = str_detect(clean_data$Genre, "Comedy", negate = FALSE),
 is_adventure = str_detect(clean_data$Genre, "Adventure", negate = FALSE),
 is_crime = str_detect(clean_data$Genre, "Crime", negate = FALSE))
only_comedy <- true_genres%>%filter(is_comedy==TRUE)
only_drama <- true_genres%>%filter(is_drama==TRUE)
only_crime <- true_genres%>%filter(is_crime==TRUE)
only_adventure <- true_genres%>%filter(is_adventure==TRUE)
only_action <- true_genres%>%filter(is_action==TRUE)

palette_Dark2 <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
ggplot(data=genres_table, aes(x=genre_name, y=Freq, fill=genre_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))+
  labs(x="Genre name", y="Frequency",
       title="Genres frequency summary")+scale_fill_manual(values = palette_Dark2(15))


```

As we can see, Drama movies are much more popular than the other genres.

What about the highest-earning decade?

```{r}
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(Decade = if_else(Released_Year >= 2000,
                          paste0(Released_Year  %/% 10 * 10, "'s"),
                          paste0((Released_Year - 1900) %/% 10 * 10, "'s")))
decade_avg<- clean_data %>%
  group_by(Decade) %>%
  summarize(average_in_millions = mean(Gross_in_millions, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  filter(!is.na(average_in_millions))

decade_avg

ggplot(data=decade_avg[-4,],aes(x=reorder(Decade, -average_in_millions), y=average_in_millions, fill=Decade)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  xlab('Decade')+
  ylab('Average Earning in millions')+
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette_Dark2(15))

```

So we can see that the latest the movie the higher the revenue. It will
be also interesting to check who are the directors with highest gross
earned by their movie. We will narrow it to the top five directors:

```{r}
DirectorByGross <- clean_data %>% group_by(Director) %>% mutate(is.na(Gross_in_millions) <- median(Gross_in_millions)) %>% 
                        summarise(totalGross = sum(Gross_in_millions), count= n()) %>%
                                arrange(desc(totalGross))  %>%  head(n = 5L)%>%
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Director, totalGross), y = totalGross, fill = Director)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_flip() + 
   geom_text(aes(label = paste0("$" ,round(totalGross)), hjust=1), size = 4) +
   labs(x = "Directors", y = "Gross amount earned by their movies in million dollars",
        title = "Top 5 directors by Gross of movies")+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12, hjust = 1),axis.text.y = element_text(size=10),
         axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),axis.text.x = element_blank())

DirectorByGross
```

So it actually makes sense; most of the names rings a bell.

After we examined the different variables and their connection to the
gross, it will be interesting to see the distribution of different
variables compared to the gross:

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p1 <-ggplot(clean_data, aes(x= votes_in_thousands)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill="Navy")
p2 <-ggplot(clean_data, aes(x= Gross_in_millions)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill="lightseagreen")
p3 <-ggplot(clean_data, aes(x=IMDB_Rating )) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill="turquoise")
p4 <-ggplot(clean_data, aes(x=Meta_score )) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill="slategray1")
p5 <-ggplot(clean_data, aes(x=Runtime )) +
  geom_histogram(bins=30, fill="blue")

grid.arrange(grobs= list(p1,p2,p3,p4,p5),
    fontface = 3, fontsize = 3,hjust = 1,x = 1)

```

We know that IMDB and MetaScore are both different types of ratings.
Let's see their distributions, compared to one another:

```{r}
Meta_IMDB_density <- ggplot(clean_data) +
  geom_density(aes(IMDB_Rating, fill ="IMDB_Rating", alpha = 0.1)) + 
  geom_density(aes(Meta_score, fill ="Meta_score", alpha = 0.1)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Variables") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Density") +
  ggtitle("Density plot of Meta score vs IMDB rating") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="PRGn")

Meta_IMDB_density
```

We can see that the mean of both ratings looks about the same (with the
exception of a little "hump" in the IMDB rating graph).

So by looking at the visualizations, it seems like we can explore
further three main graphical assumptions:

**1.** the mean of the MetaScore and the IMDB score look similar.

**2.** Drama is the most popular genre, suggesting it's also the most
profitable one.

**3.** The distributions of the Number of Votes, Gross, and IMDB rating
look similar.

Now it's time to test our assumptions.

# Modeling

IMDB rating is the score which is given to a movie by visitors in the
IMDB website. Metascore is the rating a movie received from expert film
critics. We would like to examine if they align. Every IMDB rating and
Metascore is compared to the same movie, therefore we will use paired
t.test for the comparison.

### **Paired t-test for IMDB & Meta Score**

**H0:** The average IMDB rating and the average MetaScore are equal.

**H1:** The average IMDB rating and the average MetaScore are not equal.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
boxplot(clean_data$IMDB_Rating, clean_data$Meta_score,
        names = c("IMDB Rating", "MetaScore"))

t.test(x = clean_data$IMDB_Rating,
       y = clean_data$Meta_score,
       paired = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided")
```

***Conclusion***

As we can see from the results, although it was possible to believe that
the wisdom of the crowds would align with the opinion of the experts,
from the results we found that in a confidence level of 95%, we reject
the null hypothesis. IMDB rating and MetaScore means are not equal.

### **Paired t-test for Gross of movies**

As we saw earlier in the genre's graph bar, Drama is the most common
genre by a significant margin. We know the film industry is a business
that aims to maximize profit, so it makes sense to assume that the most
common genre will be the most profitable.
Having said that, we expect the top 100 drama movies gross mean to be higher than the top 100 not drama movies gross mean. 

Let's have a quick look:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
drama_v <- true_genres%>%filter(is_drama=="TRUE")%>%na.omit()%>%arrange(desc(Gross_in_millions)) %>% slice(1:100)
top_100_v <- true_genres%>%filter(is_drama=="FALSE")%>%na.omit()%>%arrange(desc(Gross_in_millions)) %>% slice(1:100)
drama_v_mu <- mean(drama_v$Gross_in_millions)
top_100_v_mu <- mean(top_100_v$Gross_in_millions)
drama_v_mu 
top_100_v_mu
```

Surprisingly, we see that the average gross income of drama movies is
much lower than the average of rest of the movies. This leads us to believe
that the true gross income for drama movies is lower than rest of the movies
average gross income. We will take the 100
top-earning drama movies and the 100 top-earning movies in general ,and
test our new assumption. The 100 most earning movies are excluding
drama genre movies, so we will use an unpaired t.test.

**H0:** The average gross income of drama movies is equal to the average
income of the rest of movies.

**H1:** Drama is less profitable genre than the average the rest of the movies.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

boxplot(drama_v$Gross_in_millions, top_100_v$Gross_in_millions,
        names = c("100 top-earning drama movies", "100 top-earning movies"))

t.test(x = drama_v$Gross_in_millions,
       y = top_100_v$Gross_in_millions,
       paired = FALSE, alternative = "less")

```

***Conclusion***

As we can see from the results, our assumption was confirmed by the
paired t.test that we have conducted, and in a confidence level of 95%
we reject the null hypothesis- the average gross income for drama genre
movies is in fact lower than the average gross income of the rest of the genres.

### **Linear regression model**

We will start with correlation check in order to see which variables are
associated to each other.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
num_data = subset(clean_data, select = -c(Series_Title, Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4, Director, Gross, Genre, No_of_Votes,Decade ))%>%na.omit()
cor_graph =  cor(num_data)
ggcorrplot(cor_graph, type = "upper", hc.order = TRUE, outline.col = "white",ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_gray,
           colors = c("gold","white","lightseagreen"))

```


We can see a strong correlation between the Number of Votes and Gross
(which makes sense because the more people watched the movie, the more
people ranked it). We have a strong correlation between IMDB rating and
Number of Votes as well. In addition as we saw in the visualizations,
the distribution of those variables reminds each other. We will examine those connections separately in a linear regression models:

**Number of votes & Gross** 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
linear_model <- lm((votes_in_thousands) ~ log10(Gross_in_millions), data=num_data) 
summary(linear_model)
```

We can see we have around 26% of Adjusted R-squared. The adjusted
R-squared compares the explanatory power of regression models that
contain different numbers of predictors. To make it simple, **26% R
squared** indicates that the model does not imply on strong connection
between the variables. We also know that a **p.value less than 0.05 is
statistically significant.** It indicates strong evidence against the
null hypothesis.

Now we will take a look at the visualization of the linear model between number of votes & Gross: 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
votes_gross <- ggplot(num_data, aes(x=Gross_in_millions, y=votes_in_thousands))+scale_x_log10() +geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(col="royalblue1", method = "lm")

votes_gross
```

We can see that there is a pattern of the higher the number of votes the higher the gross is, but it is not significant (the 26% R squared fits pretty well here). Moreover we see that we do not have homoscedasticity here.  

Now we will take a look at the residuals plot to examine whether they are normally distributed: 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
residuals_qq<- linear_model %>% ggplot(aes(sample=.resid)) +
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(col="blue") +
  labs(title="Residuals qq Plot")
residuals_qq
```

We can see from the qq plot that our residuals **do not distribute
normally**.


***Conclusions***

In order to use our model for predicting model, two of conditions must
exist: **homoscedasticity** of the data and **normally distributed**
residuals. Our data does not answer this conditions, so our model can
not be used as a predicting model.

**Number of votes & IMDB Rating** 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
linear_model2 <- lm((votes_in_thousands) ~ (IMDB_Rating), data=num_data) 
summary(linear_model2)
```


We can see we have around 37% of Adjusted R-squared. **37% R
squared** indicates that the model does not imply on strong connection
between the variables. We also know that a **p.value less than 0.05 is
statistically significant.** It indicates strong evidence against the
null hypothesis.

Now we will take a look at the visualization of the linear model between number of votes & IMDB Rating: 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
votes_imdb <- ggplot(num_data, aes(x=IMDB_Rating, y=votes_in_thousands))+geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(col="royalblue1", method = "lm")

votes_imdb
```

We can learn from the visualization that from the lowest IMDB ratings to around 8.1 we almost do not have a difference in the number of votes, but as we go higher, specially higher than around 8.6 most of the movies receive a significantly high number of votes. But in this model as well, we can see that we do not have homoscedasticity. 

Now we will take a look at the residuals plot to examine whether they are normally distributed: 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
residuals_qq<- linear_model2 %>% ggplot(aes(sample=.resid)) +
  geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(col="blue") +
  labs(title="Residuals qq Plot")
residuals_qq
```

We can see from the qq plot that our residuals **do not distribute
normally**.


***Conclusions***

In this model as well, we could not meet the requirements of **homoscedasticity** and **normally distributed residuals**, so we can not except the model,
but we have got some more insights about the data. 



# Discussion and Summary

In our report, we explored the many ways the gross is affected.

We learned who directs the highest-earning movies and also what are the
top-earning decades.

We found that the average rating of the MetaScore and IMDB is not the
same, and also learned that the profits of Drama films are quite low
compared to other films, even though it is the most popular genre.
Finally, in both of the Linear Regression Tests we received a low
p.value, which is statistically significant, indicating strong evidence
against the null hypothesis. The model assumptions aren't met, so we can
confirm that the model's outcome cannot be fully trusted.

Thank you for reading!
